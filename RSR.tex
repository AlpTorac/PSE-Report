\chapter{Purpose}
\section{Product Goal}
\bigskip
"Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth." 

-George Washington \\


Liberty format is a text based file format where cell libraries are stored. These cell libraries can store a lot of information about components. However, the liberty files usually contain thousands of lines of text, which makes them impractical to read, to find desired values or to compare cells/pins with each other. \bigskip

What we aim to achieve is to make it easier for everyone to understand liberty files and also to easily make operations on them.  \bigskip

With the help of a hierarchical display of the files the user will be able to navigate through the levels of the library easily. By using different types of statistics and visualizations it will be easier to see the behaviors of components and also to compare them with each other. GELF's(Graphical Editor for Liberty Files) way of visualizing Liberty Files by drawing complicated values in a graph makes the viewer examine different component attributes and behaviours. Instead of being forced to read thousands of lines of hard to understand text, GELF will provide the same information in a much more direct and manageable way, so that the user can work around these complicated files with ease.\bigskip

GELF is going to give this liberty to everyone trying to understand Liberty Files or work with them.
\section{Target Audience}
Target audience for GELF desktop app is mainly hardware and electrical engineers, who are dealing with Liberty Files. GELF can be used by anyone with a computer with Linux. It provides an easier to work environment for Liberty Files, which will help engineers to observe and examine behaviors of components. It also make it possible to compare different components by their different attributes, which would further help engineers to spot the characteristics of components and make decisions about them.
\chapter{Scenarios}
\section{Comparing Components}
A portable device manufacturer aims to make their new device's battery last longer than the devices 
of rival companies. For that to happen the device should have the least possible amount of power 
leakage while in sleep mode. So they decide to compare different components by their 
leakage information. 

They open GELF desktop app, then open two liberty files through file manager. 
The liberty files get displayed hierarchically in a tree view.

First they select their libraries and open them in two different panels with
the options of "Editor" and "View". They select "View" to visualize information about the libraries.
From the drop down menu of attributes they select leakage power in both panels and a bar chart is drawn in
both panels, showing the averages of leakage powers of cells in the libraries. 

Then they select these two libraries from the tree view on the left and click on "Compare". 
A new panel opens with just "View" option for comparison. They again select leakage power and see that the two bar charts 
from before are put on top of each other.

With a click on a name of the cell on the first two panels, the cell view is opened in the panels with images
of the cells. They click on different checkboxes near pin names to change the function of cells and to see the leakage 
power values accordingly.

They select two cells from the tree view, click on "Compare" and select leakage power. The 
bar charts are put on top of each other with functions of cells as indexes. At last they select 10 different cells and select
default leakage value and a bar chart appears, which has a single value for each selected cell.

With all the information at their hand, they decide which components would be more beneficial for them to use. 
They make some adjustments in the text editor and merge the components they want to use in a new file. They save the file 
on the computer and close the program.
