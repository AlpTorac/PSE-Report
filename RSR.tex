\chapter{Purpose}
\section{Product Goal}
\bigskip
"Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth." 

George Washington \\


Liberty format is a text based file format where cell libraries are stored.These cell libraries can store  a lot of information about components. However, the liberty files usually contain thousands of lines of text, which makes them not practical to read, to find desired values or to compare cells/pins with each other. \bigskip

What we aim to achieve is to make it easier for everyone to understand liberty files and also to easily make operations on them.  \bigskip

With the help of a hierarchical display of the files the user will be able to navigate through the levels of the library easily. By using different types of statistics and visualizations it will be easier to see the behaviors of components and also comparing them with each other. GELF's way of visualizing stuff like drawing complicated values in a graph makes the viewer examine different component attributes and behaviours. Instead of being forced to read thousands of lines of hard to understand text, GELF will provide the same information in a much more direct and manageable way, so that the user can work around these complicated files with ease.\bigskip

GELF is going to give this liberty to everyone trying to understand Liberty Files or work with them.
\section{Target Audience}
Target audience for GELF desktop app is mainly hardware and software engineers, who are dealing with Liberty Files. GELF can be used by anyone with a computer with Linux or Windows. It provides an easier to work environment for Liberty Files, which will help engineers to observe and examine behaviors of components. It also make it possible to compare different components by their different attributes, which would further help engineers to spot the characteristics of components and make decisions about them.
